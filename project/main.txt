pitch detection, harmonic modeling, and waveform synthesis.

Pitch Detection:
Map to frequency and appy fourier

Timbre and Harmonic Content:

Attack and Decay Characteristics:
Capture the percussive attack and decay of guitar notes. Adjust these characteristics to match the quicker attack and shorter decay typical of piano notes.

Sustain and Release:
Model the sustain and release phases of the piano sound. Pianos have the ability to sustain notes for a more extended period, especially when using the sustain pedal. Adjust the guitar sound to simulate this effect.

Polyphony Handling:
Consider how your algorithm handles polyphony (multiple notes played simultaneously). Pianos are polyphonic instruments, so your conversion process should account for and accurately handle multiple concurrent notes.

Dynamic Range:
Pianos have a wide dynamic range, allowing for both soft and loud playing. Adjust the dynamic characteristics of the guitar sound to match the piano's expressive range.

Velocity Sensitivity:
Pianos are velocity-sensitive, meaning the force with which a key is struck affects the volume and often the tonal characteristics. Implement velocity sensitivity in your conversion process to capture the dynamics of piano playing.

Resonance:
Consider modeling sympathetic resonances that occur in a piano. When certain notes are played, other related strings can vibrate sympathetically, contributing to the overall sound. Simulating this effect can enhance the realism of the piano sound.
Pedal Effects:
If applicable, model the effects of piano pedals, especially the sustain pedal. The sustain pedal allows notes to resonate and adds to the sustain phase of piano sound.

Note Transitions:
Smoothly handle transitions between notes. Pianos have unique characteristics in how one note transitions to the next, and your conversion should reproduce these transitions faithfully.



PROCESSES

Pitch Detection:
Method: Crepe

Timbre and Harmonic Content:
Method: Spectral Analysis (e.g., FFT - Fast Fourier Transform)
Description: Extract the frequency content of the audio signal to identify the harmonics and their amplitudes. Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) can also be used to capture timbral characteristics.

Attack and Decay Characteristics:
Method: Envelope Extraction
Description: Use methods such as ADSR (Attack, Decay, Sustain, Release) envelope extraction to identify the onset and decay of each note.

Sustain and Release:
Method: Envelope Extraction, Sustain Modeling
Description: Apply envelope extraction to model sustain and release phases. Additionally, consider modeling sustain using algorithms that simulate string resonance or sympathetic vibrations.

Polyphony Handling:
Method: Polyphonic Pitch Detection
Description: Extend pitch detection algorithms to handle multiple concurrent notes, enabling polyphonic pitch tracking.

Dynamic Range:
Method: Dynamic Range Compression/Expansion
Description: Apply dynamic range compression or expansion to adjust the volume levels, ensuring a wide dynamic range suitable for piano-like expression.

Velocity Sensitivity:
Method: Velocity Sensitivity Mapping
Description: Implement velocity sensitivity by mapping the force or speed of the guitar note to the intensity of the synthesized piano note.

Resonance:
Method: Physical Modeling, Resonance Filtering
Description: Use physical modeling techniques to simulate sympathetic resonances. Apply filters to mimic the resonant frequencies of piano strings.

Pedal Effects:
Method: Pedal Modeling
Description: Implement algorithms to simulate the effects of piano pedals, such as sustain. Modify the decay and sustain parameters accordingly.

Note Transitions:
Method: Transition Modeling
Description: Develop algorithms to handle smooth transitions between notes. Consider techniques like crossfading or applying specialized algorithms for legato playing.
