Intesnsity, loudness and timbre

Sound Power
This is a physicla measure
Rate at which energy is transferred
Energy per unit of time emitted by a sound source in all directions across the medium (air)
Measured in watt(W)

Sound intensity is sound power per unit area
Measured in W/m squared

Threshold of hearing (TOH)
Humans can perciev sounds wth very small intensitites
TOH = 10 raised to the power of -12 W/m squared

Threshold of pain (TOP)
TOP = 10 . W/m squared

Intesnity level
Descrbes the intensity of sound
Its put on a logarithmic scale
Measured in decibels (dB)
It is a ratio between two intensity values
Use an intensity of refrence (TOH)

Intensity level 

dB(I) = 10 . log10(I/ITOH)

Check Screenshot

Whats 0 dB

dB(ITOH) = 10. log10 (ITOH/ITOH) = 0

- Everytime we go up by 3db the intensity doubles

Loudness

Subective measure of soound Intesnity

Depends on age
Measured in phons
Loudness depends on the ratio and frequency of the sound
At equal intensity We hear shorter sounds as less loud

Timbre

Diffence between two sounds with the same intensity, frequency and duration (eg sam note on different instruments)
It is multidimensional
What are the features of timbre?

- Sound Envelope
- Harmonic content
- Amplitude/ frequency modulation

Sound Envelope
- Attack-Decay-Sustain-Release Model (ADSR)
-Chec screenshot
- Sound usually has an envelop that can be divided by the ADSR model
Attack- the amplitude has an initial spike 
Decay - the sound stabilises 
Sustain- the sound remains constant in amplitude
Release - fading out phase of sound
Different types of sounds have different envelopes based on music instrument
Pano short attack, a transient little period of decay , long sustain and shprt release
Violin has a longer attack in terms of time, no decay some sustain then the release

Harmononic Content
To understand harmonic content we need to understand what a complex sound is made up of
A complex soud is made up of a superposition of many sinusoids(fundamental simple sounds)
A partial is a sinusoid used to describe sound. Many different sinusoid superimposed together to for a complx sound are called partals, harmonic partial
The lowest partial is called the fundamental frequency that gives a puith name to a note
Harmonic partials is a frequency thats an integer multiple of the fundamental frequuency
f1 = 440hz, f2 =2.440 = 880Hz, f3 = 3.440 = 1320
first partial, second apartial, third partial
Complex sound is madeup of these partials and the harmonic content tells us how much energy is there in ech of te partials thus determining timbre of the sound
Inharmonicity indicates a devation from a harmonic partial

Frequency modulation
- Modulation in sound itself
- Frequency modulation is called vibrato
- Has periodic variaion in frequency
- A vibrato effect is done with frequency modulation

Amplitude Modulation
- Known as tremolo
- Periodic variation in amplitude

Timbre Recap
- Multifactorial sound dimension
- Amplitude envelopes
- Distribution of energy across partials
- Signal modulation(frequency/amplitude)

Sound Recap
- Sound is a wave
