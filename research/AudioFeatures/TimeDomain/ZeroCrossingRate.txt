- Indicates the number of times a signal crosses the horizontal axis

- Compare the amplitude value for consecutive pairs of samples and look whether there there are differences in signs of those amplitudes for consecutve pairs of samples

sgn - sign function (gives us bakck the sign of a given value 
   s(k) > 0 -> +1
   s(k) < 0 -> -1
   s(k) = 0 -> 0
   ) 

sgn(s(k)) - sign for amplitude at sample k
sgn(s(k + 1)) - sign for amplitude for sample (k+1) (consecutive sample)
If we have both amplitude values that have the same sign, we get 0
If we have alternate opposite signs we get a value of 2 


               (t+1)* K-1
ZCRt = 1/2 *       Î£      | sgn(s(k)) - sgn(s(k+1)) |
                  k=t.k

Sum over all the samples n a frame K  so as to get the value of all the zero crossings on a frame

Applications

- Recognition of percussive  vs pitched sounds
- Monophonic pitch estimation (rudimentary) as there is a relation between number of zero crossings and the pitch
If we have monohonic pitch then the higher the number of zerocrossings we have, the higheer the pitch is going to between
- Voice/ unvoiced decision for speech signals
Because in voice signals we have a lower zero crossing rates
