- This is the max amplitude value taken out of all the samples in a frame
AEt = amplitude envelop at frame t
K - frame size (total number of samples in the given frame)
k = t. K (first sample frame t)
(t+1) * K -1 - last sample of frame t
s(K) - amplitude of sample k
check screenshot for Amplitude envelop formula
Calculate AE for all frames

       (t+1) . K-1
AEt =      max       s(K)
        k=t.K

- For each frame take the highest (max) value of the amplitude

- Amplitude Envelope gives us a rough idea of the loudness of the signal
- Sensitive to Outliers as one is getting the amplitude for one sample out of all samples in a frame
- Amplitude Envelopes is used in:
  Onset detection (e.g when one note starts)
  Music genre classification
  
Implement amplitude Envelope
Visualise amplitude enevlope fro different music genres
