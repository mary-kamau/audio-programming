- Takes the root mean square of all the sampes in a frame
- Check formula screenshot
RMSt - Root Mean Square Energy at frame t
K - All Samples in frame
s(k) squared - Energy of the kth sample

(t+1)* K-1
Σ           - Sum of energy for all samples in frame t
k=t.k
       
        (t+1)* K-1
1/K   *      Σ           - mean of sun of energy
        k=t.k
               
                    
                            (t+1)* K-1
RMSt = square root  1/K   *      Σ     
                             k=t.k     

- Root mean square energy is an indicator of loudness
- Less sensitive to Outliers than AE as it considers all the samples  

Applications
- Identifying new segments in an audio signal ( Audio Segmantation)
- Music genre classification
