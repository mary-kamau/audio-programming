Time Domain Features
Frequency Features
Audio Features
Audio Features are descripters of sound. They provide information about different aspects oof sound
Characterised by:
 - Level of abstraction
 - Temporal scope
 - Music aspects
 -Signal Domain
 - ML Approach

1. Level of abstraction

- Divided into:
1.High level ( instrumentation, key, chords, melody, rhythm, tempo, lyrics, genre, mood)
- Vey abstract features that map to musical costructs tha can be perceived 
2. Mid-level ( pitch and beat related descriptors such as note onsets, flanctuation patterns, MFCCs)
- 
3.Low-level(amplitude envelope, energy, spectral centroid, spectral flux, zeroo-crossing rate)
- These are features that make sense for machines not human being.
they re statistical features that get extracted from the Audio

2. Temporal scope

- This is a strategy for categorising audio features. It applies to many types of sound (music and non music)
1. Instantaneous ( about 50ms)
- Give instat info about audio Signalconsiders very shor chunks of audio Signal
2. Segment-level (seconds)
- Audio features that can be calculated in segments of audio
- Features that give us information about a bar or phrase. Somehing that makes sennse in a musical context
3. Global
- Give us information about the whole sound.
- Are like aggregate features.

3. Music aspects

- Beat, Timbre, Pitch, Harmony
- Note onset relates to beat or melody
- Key relates to harmony and pitch

4. Signal Domain

4. Time Domain

- Time Domain Features (Amplitude envelope, Root-mean square energy, Zero crossing rate)
- They are time domain features since they are extracted from the waveform.
- The time domain is captured in a waveform ( the x axis is time and the y axis is amplitude)

5. Frequency Domain

- Sound is characterised by frequency
- These focus on frequency components ( Band Energy ratio, Spectral centroid, spectral flux)
- What is the frequency domain? How do we get it?
- Take the raw audio, apply Fourrier Transform and translate the signal from the time domain to the frequency domain.
- This returns a spectrum (x axis frequency, y axis magnitude)

6. Time-Frequency Domain features

- These focus on both time and frequency they are ( Spectrogram, Mel-spectrogram, Constant-Q transform)
- We can get the spectrogram by taking the time domain representation and apply Short Time Fourier Transform.

7. ML Approach

- Traditional Machine Learning (Looks at all audio features)
Amplitude envelope
Root-mean square energy
Zero crossing rate
Band energy ratio
Spectral centroid
Spectral flux
Spectral spread
Spectral roll-off

- Deep Learning
- Pass unstructerd audio reppresentation e.g raw audio, pass spectrogram lke audio features
