# Sound is produced by vibrating obects. Vibrations cause air molecules to oscillate. These air molecules then cause change in air pressure in the region they're acting thus creating a wave.
#Sound is a wave that transmits some energy from oe point to another through air molecules.
#Sound is a mechnaical wave.
#A mechanical wave is an oscillation that travels through space. Energy travels from one point to another.Mechanical waves need a medium through which wave can expad and propagate through.
#In sound the medium is air
# Waveform
#Carries multifactorial information
# - Frequency
# - Intensity
# - Timbre
#Sound can be divided into :
    Periodic Sound
    Aperiodic Sound
Periodic Sound is where the Compressions and Rarefactions repeat regularly
   - Single Sine Waveform
   - Complex Sound (Multiple Sinewaves)

Aperiodic Sound
   - No periodicity
   - Continous Waveform ( Dont follow any pattern i the air pressure (Noise))
   - Transient (Pulse)

Waveform for sinple Sine wave 
    y(t) = Asin(2πft + φ)
A = amplitude
f = frequency
t = time
φ  = phase

Frequency ( f )
Frequency is connected with period which is the amount of time needed to elapse before having two picks or two dips. 
Frequency is the inverse of the period 1/T. 
It is expressed in Hz that is number of cycles per second

Amplitude ( A )
Amplitude is how high or low the change in pressure goes.

Phase ( φ )
Phase enables us to shift the waveform to the right or to the left.
It tells us what is the position of the waveform at time 0

- The higher the frequency the higher the sound that is perceived (shorter period)
- The larger the amplitude the louder the sound

Hearing Range
-Humans hearing range between 20Hz - 20,000Hz

Pitch
- Pitch is used in the perception of frequency
- Logarithm perception
- 2 frequencies are perceive to be the same if they differ by a power of 2 ( Octave )

Mappig pitch to frequency

F(p) = 2 raised to the power of (p-69)/12 x 440

Check screenshot

What is the relaionship between two subsequent pitches?

F(p +1) / F(p) = 2 raised to power (1/12) 


Cents

Octave is divided into 1200 Cents
100 cents in a semitone
Noticable pithc difference 10-25 cents
