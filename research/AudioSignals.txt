Convert Analog Signal to Digital Audio Signal

An audio signal is a represenation of sound
It encodes all the info we need to reproduce sound

Analog signal 
Conttinous vaues for time
Contibous values of amplitude

Digital Signal
Sequence of discrete values
Data points can ony take on a finite number of values

Analog to Digital Conversion 
Consists of :
Sampling
Quantization
Output is an audio digittal signal also known as pulse-code modulation

Sampling
- Sample dataponts across a sound wave at specific points in time
- We sample by deciding on a period and we sample at equidistant intervals in time
- How do we locate samples on time:
 tn = n. T (time where we have sample number n)

Sampling rate
This is the inverse of period T
Sr = 1/T
It is a frequency (Hz)
It indicates the number of samples we have for each second of the digital signal
Check low vs high sample rate screenshot
Low sample rate means that the smapling period is higher, that is the interval between samples
Sampling error - There's a difference between the area below the curve and the area created by the vertical bars, this difference is the sampling error that is the information that we loose when sampling
The higher the sample rate the lower te sampling error.
Why sampling rate fro CD = 44100Hz?

Nyquist Frequency
   fN = Sr/2

Check screenshot

It tells us the upper bound frequency that we can have in a digital signal that's not going to recreate any artifacts
Up until the nyquist frequency we can create a signal but above that we have artifacts
fN = 44100/2 = 22050Hz
This means that we can appreciate the whole frequecy range without artifacts
What are the artifacts?
Artifacts inected in a signal if we have frequencies that are above the Nyquist frequency are determined by Aliasing

Aliasing
- Check screenshot
- It shifts down all frequencies above the Nyquist Frequency

Quantization
- Check screenshot
Quantization samples on the y axis, i.e amplitude
The idea is that we have a fixed discrete number of amplitude vaues on y axis
At each sample we quantize the value of amplitude to the closest value we have available on the y axis.
Apply quantization creates a quantization error.
The higher the quantoization resolution the lower the quantization error
- Values are binary values(4 bits) as the signal is stored in digital computers
Resolution = numbe rof bits  also known as Bit Depth
- CD resolution is 16 bits (Bit depth = 16 bits)
2 raised to power 16 giving 65536Hz
These are all the posiible valyes tat can be used when we quantize an anlog signal in a CD
Check the amount of Hard Disk memory for 1 minute of sound expressed in MB,
- Depends on ampling rate = 44100Hz
- Bit depth = 16 bits
(((16*44, 100) / 1, 048, 576)/8) * 60 = 5.49MB

Dynamic range
- Difference between largest/smallest signal a system can record
- The higher the resolution the higher the dynamic range

Signal-to-quantization-noise ratio
- This is the relationship between max signal strength and quantization error
- Measured in decibles
- Correlates with Dynamic

    SQNR =  6.02 * Q where Q is the bit depth
